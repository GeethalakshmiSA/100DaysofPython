# Introduction

* Python is a High-Level Multi-purpose programming language
* Also, called as Dynamically Typed Language
* Has objected-oriented and procedural paradigms
* Has huge collection of standard libraries for various cutting-edge technologies
	
## Bit of History
		
- Created By - Guido Van Rossum
- Year - 1991
- Further developed by - Python Software Foundation
- Designed as - simple code readability and syntax made simple to make code with fewer lines
		
### Purpose or Facts or Features
		
- Performs automatic memory management
- Supports multiple programming paradigms
- Versatile
- Easy-to-use
- Interpreted
	- no separate compilation and execution like other languages
	- run the program directly
	- source code is converted internally to a intermediate form called bytecode
	- bytecode is then translated to native language of specific computer
	- no worry on loading libraries
- Platform Independent
	- Accessible across multiple OS
	- like windows, linux, mac, etc
- Free and Open Source
- no need to take care on low-level details such as managing the memory
- Robust - memory management techniques are in-built
- Has vast and rich library support
		
### Different Versions & their differences
		
Version difference to be known between - V2 and V3 :

**V2::**
- Released in 2000
- print is statement and not function
- strings are stored as ASCII by default
- Division on 2 numbers gives integral value (ex. 7/2 is 3)
- Exceptions are enclosed in notations
- Values of global variables do change if given inside for loop
- xrange function defined for iterations
- More Libraries are not forward compatible
- Mostly used by Devops Engineer
- No longer in use since 2020
- Syntax is complex to understand
- Rules of ordering comparsions are complex
				
**V3::**
- Released in 2008
- print is function and not statement
- Strings are stored as UNICODE by default
- Division on 2 numbers gives floating-point value (ex. 7/2 is 3.5)
- Exceptions are enclosed in parentheses
- Values of variables never change
- Range function introduced to perform iterations
- Lot libraries created to use within Py3 
- More popular than V2
- Used in lot of fields like software engineering, data science, etc.
- Simple Syntax
- Rules of ordering comparsions have been simplified
				
*Latest Version - Python 3.10.2 (released on January 2022)*
